                    <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
                    <p>As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined</p>
                    <p>You must have had yourself a change of heart like</p>
                    <p>Halfway through the drive</p>
                    <p>'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign</p>
                    <p>Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face</p>
                    <p>And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace</p>
                    <p>And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains</p>
                    <p>Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
                    <p>And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks</p>
                    <p>And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed</p>
                    <p>And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim</p>
                    <p>I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>And I'll dream each night of some version of you</p>
                    <p>That I might not have, but I did not lose</p>
                    <p>Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes</p>
                    <p>And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
                    <p>So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad</p>
                    <p>That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad</p>
                    <p>No, I am no longer funny, 'cause I miss the way you laugh</p>
                    <p>You once called me forever, now you still can't call me back</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
                    <p>And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks</p>
                    <p>And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed</p>
                    <p>And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim</p>
                    <p>I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas</p>

                    <p>Oh, that'll have to do</p>
                    <p>My other half was you</p>
                    <p>I hope this pain's just passing through</p>
                    <p>But I doubt it</p>
