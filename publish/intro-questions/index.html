        <p>1. My name is Madison Wang and I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design, minoring in CS and HCI.</p>
        <p>2. I am interested in how much I can push user expectations with the help of HTML and CSS. Especially when thinking about going into UX/UI.</p>
        <p>3. I am pretty well-versed in Webflow but haven't done much outside of that.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn the most efficient way to write HTML and CSS and learning my own process.</p>
        <p>5. Designing for the screen seems harder on the execution side, not everything is always possible with certain technical abilities.</p>

            This portfolio website is clean and easy to follow while also using special features such as infinite scroll to make it seem more populated.

            This website is very simple with one main feature that effectively communicates section of art history through a view that most people are familiar with.
