                <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
            </div>
            
            <h3><a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated" target="_blank">America's Test Kitchen</a></h3>
            <p>They have a very convenient filter system that lets you narrow down the options very efficiently. They also put the rating and amount of people who have rated it in the preview so it gives the user a good gauge of how popular it is.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/" target="_blank">Minimalist Baker</a></h3>
            <p>The featured section (which is right at the beginning of the website) has seasonal recipies and really targets a specific area that I think is really smart. I think the best feature is the part where there are a bunch of icons that represent vegan, vegetarian, etc. It's really helpful for when people are looking for something specific and can easily spot something they might like to try.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/" target="_blank">Budget Bytes</a></h3>
            <p>Many recipe pages has a pretty long introduction along with a more in-depth explanation on the dish which most users scroll to skip anyway. This site has a "jump to recipe" button at the top of the page so it makes it really easy for the user to get to exactly where they need without wasting time searching.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.blimp.gr/" target="_blank">The Blimp</a></h3>
            <p>I really enjoy how interactive this website is, even without knowing the complete context of it. It draws me in and makes me stay curious enough to explore what the website is trying to accomplish. I think the "album of the day" section is very useful and it makes me think about how adding a feature section on my own website could engage the user a little more.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.accordion.net.au/work" target="_blank">Accordion</a></h3>
            <p>I think the layout of the accordion design is very intuitive and I enjoy how you can see the overview of the content on the side as you are scrolling. Having little icons for my recipies could make it easier to browse and search for content in a more interactive way.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://engage.gettyimages.com/archive-collections#/" target="_blank">Getty Images</a></h3>
            <p>This is a really successful archive website beause no only is it clean and stylized in a editorial way, which makes sense with the gallery content, it is very well organized with separation into collections. There is a clear separation of content and linear user flow making it very easy to interact with.</p>
